# RoboticaUVic-PR-week1
UVic Robotics Master. Pattern Recognition Homework 1

## Instructions



## Preliminaries

This and the next three homework assignments have to be completed
using Python. Python is a very easy to learn and flexible programming
language, with many libraries for the most diverse tasks.

For the homework in this course, we will use the following libraries, mostly from the SciPy family:
- [SciPy http://www.scipy.org/] is a collection of libraries for scientific computing in Python.
- [Numpy http://www.numpy.org/] provides the backbone functionality for numerical processing.
- [Matplotlib http://matplotlib.org/] is a powerful plotting library.
- [OpenCV http://opencv.org/] is the reference computer vision and image processing library, with comprehensive Python bindings.
Besides these required libraries, IPython is recommended as an extended and more friendly interactive python interpreter.

Under Ubuntu 14.10, all this software can be installed with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-numpy python-matplotlib libopencv* python-opencv
sudo apt-get install ipython
```
